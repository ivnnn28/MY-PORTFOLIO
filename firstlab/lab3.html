  <style= "font-family: verdana">
   Many people use the terms <strong style="color:">Internet</strong> and the  World Wide Web interchangeably. But in fact, 
  <br> the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two 
  <br> separated but related things. 
  <p></p> 
  <br> The <strong style="color: ">Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. 
  <br> It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which 
  <br> any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both 
  <br> connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of 
  <br> languages called <i>"Protocols"</i>. 
  <p></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <br> The <strong style="color:">World Wide Web</strong> or simply <i>"Web"</i>, is a way of accessing information over 
  <br> the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on 
  <br> top of the internet. The Web uses the <strong style="color:">HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages 
  <br> spoken over the internet, to transmit data.
